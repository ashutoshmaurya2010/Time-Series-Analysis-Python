Time-Series Data:
A time series contains data points that increase, decrease, or otherwise change in chronological order over a period.
A time series that incorporates the records of a single feature or variable is called a univariate time series.
If the records incorporate more than one feature or variable, the series is called a multivariate time series.
In addition, a time series can be designated in two ways: continuous or discrete.


In a discrete time series , data observation is carried out at a specific time or equally spaced,
as with temperature increases or decreases, exchange rates of currencies, air pressure data, etc. 

Cross-Section Data:
Cross-section data is data gathered at a specific point of time for several subjects such as closing prices of a 
particular group of stocks on a specific date, opinion polls of elections, obesity level in population, etc. 
Cross-section studies are utilized in many research areas such as medical, economics, psychology, etc.


Panel Data/Longitudinal Data
Panel data/longitudinal data contains observations of multiple occurrences collected over various durations of time
 for the same individuals. It is data that is determined periodically by the number of observations in cross-sectional 
data units such as individuals, companies, or government agencies.

Trend:
A trend is a pattern that is observed over a period of time and represents the mean rate of change with respect to time.
A trend usually shows the tendency of the data to increase/uptrend or decrease/downtrend during the long run. 
It is not always necessary that the increase or decrease is in the same direction throughout the given period of time. 
A trend line is also drawn using candlestick charts.

The Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter has become a benchmark for getting rid of trend movements in data.
